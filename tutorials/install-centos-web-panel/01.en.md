# Install CentOS Web Panel on Centos 6/7

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the installation of CentOS Web Panel.

CentOS Web Panel (CWP) is a control panel designed to work with dedicated virtual servers. With it, the user is able to manage resources of his web hosting by an accessible, intuitive and interactive interface. And, one of its greatest attractions, is to be free.

**Prerequisites**

Before you learn how to install CWP into a VPS or Dedicated, you need to make sure that your service has the minimum hardware and software requirements for the system to run perfectly.

Below are the specs:

```
Operating System: CentOS 6 or CentOS 7
RAM memory: 4 GB available to install and support all modules (recommended)
Disk Space: 10 GB of free space.
```

## Step 1 - Configure Hostname

To begin the installation of CWP, log in to your server as ```root``` and be sure to use the correct ```hostname```.

Using a text editor, open the server’s ```/etc/sysconfig/network``` file. The following example shows how to open this file in the GNU nano text editor:

```nano /etc/sysconfig/network```

Modify the ```HOSTNAME=``` value to match your FQDN hostname, as shown in the following example:

```HOSTNAME=myserver.hetzner.com```

Run the hostname command. This command enables you to change the hostname on the server:

```hostnamectl set-hostname myserver.hetzner.com```

Use the following command to restart networking on your server to ensure that changes persist on restart:

```/etc/init.d/network restart```

## Step 2 - Prepare your server with CWP Compatible Packages

After setting the hostname, you need to update the server with the latest version. In addition to installing the ```WGET``` applications to be able to install the CWP script later.

Enter the commands below into the Linux SHELL (the commands terminal):

```
yum –y install wget
yum –y update
yum -y upgrade
```

I recommend that you reboot your server after you have run the commands, use the following command: ```reboot```

### Step 3 - Install the CWP (CentOS Web Panel)

Use the command below to download CWP and install it in your VPS or Dedicated:

```
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://centos-webpanel.com/cwp-latest
sh cwp-latest
```

The installation should take between 10 and 20 minutes. Once the installation is done you should click enter to restart the server.

### Step 4 - Configuring the CWP Web Panel

The most important step, which is the installation of the CWP, you have already completed. Now you just need to make some settings in the control panel properties. Follow the instructions below to access the CWP panel:

Open your internet browser. Access the CWP interface with the address: ```http://10.0.0.1:2030/``` (10.0.0.1 is the ipv4 of your server, you should replace with your ipv4).
